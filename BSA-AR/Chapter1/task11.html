                    As a BrightSign Authorized Reseller, you have several obligations and responsibilities. Most importantly, you are required to enforce our Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policy and offer Tier 1 technical support to your customers. Additionally, you'll need to interface with BrightSign sales and support, direct customers to our training modules, and access BrightSign resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BrightSign maintains a Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) Policy. As an Authorized Reseller, you agree to enforce this policy by advertising BrightSign products at or above the minimum price. The MAP for all BrightSign products cannot be less than the full list prices for those products advertised in the current listings on BrightSign’s company web store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BrightSign Authorized Resellers are required to have at least one technical support staff member responsible for Tier 1 technical support of BrightSign products and network services. Support staff can enroll in additional BrightSign Academy courses for free to develop the skills necessary to provide Tier 1 technical support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Authorized Resellers are expected to promote BrightSign players and network services to customers. This may include presenting marketing materials to prospective customers and communicating your efforts with your BrightSign sales contacts. You will also need to stay up to date on BrightSign product announcements and initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Authorized Resellers are required to identify themselves as resellers, rather than BrightSign employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, as an Authorized Reseller, you are obligated to only offer the manufacturer’s warranty and not offer warranties beyond the scope of the warranty provided by BrightSign.
