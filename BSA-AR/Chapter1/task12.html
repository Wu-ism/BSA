<div class="container">
    <p>After you place an order, BrightSign will send an order acknowledgement within seven days. Once payment has been received, BrightSign will fulfill the order as quickly as commercially practical.</p>

    <p>The terms for shipment of the products are FOB origin or Ex Works. "FOB origin" means the purchaser pays the shipping cost from the factory or warehouse and gains ownership of the goods as soon as they leave the point of origin. "Ex Works" means that the seller shall deliver the goods as soon as they are made available to the buyer at the seller's premises or another designated location (e.g., factory, plant, warehouse, etc.).</p>

    <p>Products will be delivered to the reseller or customer with the firmware installed that is current at the time of manufacturing.</p>

    <p>The reseller agrees to pay applicable taxes, meaning BrightSign isn't responsible for any sales, use, excise, import or export, value-added, or similar tax or duty not based on BrightSignâ€™s net income.</p>

    <p>If changes to the functionality of BrightSign products or services occur, BrightSign will notify resellers of such changes at least sixty (60) days before the scheduled implementation. If the changes do not affect functionality, notice is not required.</p>
