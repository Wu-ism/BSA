                        <p><span class="sub-title">I am brand new to BrightSign and I don’t know where to start. Can you help me?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Sure! Visit our <a href="https://www.brightsign.biz/nl/support/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick start guide</a>.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">How do I set up a player using the web interface?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Setting up a player using the web interface is similar to using the desktop client. If you are setting up manually (saving setup files to a microSD card), you must use the desktop client. The web client supports only remote device activation and provisioning.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I have an older player. How do I connect it to BSN.cloud?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">For players running BrightSign OS 8 or below, update to the latest Production Release. Download the update package from <a href="http://BrightSign.biz/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrightSign.biz/downloads</a>, save the contents to a blank exFAT or FAT32 formatted microSD card, insert it into the player, and press reset. The player will reboot several times to install the update. After installation, you should see the purple activation screen.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I powered the player and plugged it into a display, but I see a blank screen. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Ensure you have a known working environment. Check power, cables, network, displays, inputs/outputs. If the player isn't connected to the internet, you should see the white on-device setup. If connected, you should see the purple activation screen. If the screen is blank, the player may have been provisioned automatically. Try publishing a presentation to the player.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I see a purple screen with a QR code. How do I set up my player?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Follow the on-screen instructions and visit <a href="https://bsn.cloud/activate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bsn.cloud/activate</a> (use Chrome). You can set up a player network, and once the setup is complete, publish a presentation to the default player group.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I see the on-device setup screen. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">The player may not be able to connect to the internet, possibly due to a firewall or network configuration. Check the network settings or use an Ethernet connection.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">How do I add a device to my network?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">You can add a device using the activation code on the purple screen or by manually adding it under "Device Provisioning" in BrightAuthor:connected, where you'll need the player's serial number.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">The player still plays old content after a factory reset. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Delete the provisioning record from your network under "Device Provisioning." Otherwise, the player will self-activate and play the previously published content.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I lost access because the person who set up the player left. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Unfortunately, BrightSign can't delete a provisioning record due to privacy concerns, but we can help you regain access to the BSN.cloud account/network to manage the device.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I am using a partner application CMS and having issues. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">If you're using a third-party CMS like Appspace or Signagelive, contact their support staff for assistance.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I forgot my credentials. How do I log in to my BSN.cloud account?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">On the login page, click "Forgot Password" and follow the instructions to reset your credentials.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I published a presentation, but it’s not playing on the device. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Ensure the player is active in the network. Use the network tab to check the player's output and confirm the presentation is being sent. Make sure you published the presentation to the correct player group.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">I got a 30-day free trial, but I can’t update the content. What should I do?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">Your trial may have expired. You will need to purchase a subscription to continue using the Content Cloud.</p>

                        <p><span class="sub-title">What video, image, and audio formats should I use?</span></p>
                        <p class="content">For video, use .mp4 with H.264 or H.265 codecs. For HD, use 4000-9000 kbps, and for 4K, use 8000-14000 kbps. <a href="https://support.brightsign.biz/hc/en-us/articles/218065137-Supported-video-formats-and-codecs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about supported video formats</a>.</p>
